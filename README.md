# Dashboard of Samples

I have created an easy to use dashboard that will read the various samples gathered from all subjects with the following functionality:

## Demographics
Get basic demographics of the subject

## Top Ten Samples
An easy to read graph of the top ten samples and amounts

## Sample Chart
Bubble chart to graph the type and value of each bacteria
